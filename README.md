## 🚀 About Me

I'm a full-stack developer with over 7 years of experience working across frontend, backend, databases, and cloud infrastructure. I prefer a JavaScript-first approach and enjoy building scalable, maintainable systems using modern frameworks and tooling.

- 💻 Comfortable across the stack — from building SPAs with Angular, React, and Next.js to developing APIs and services with Node.js, Fastify, NestJS, and GraphQL
- 🛠️ Hands-on with relational and non-relational databases including MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, CosmosDB, and graph databases like Neo4j
- ☁️ Cloud-agnostic and experienced with Azure, AWS, GCP, and DigitalOcean — deploying apps using Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines
- 🔄 Familiar with messaging, streaming, and caching systems like Kafka, RabbitMQ, Redis, and ADX
- 📬 Integrated various third-party services like Twilio, SendGrid, and payment gateways; built systems using WebSockets, SSE, and RESTful APIs
- 🧪 Worked with testing tools like Jest, Mocha, JMeter; version control with GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and project tracking with Jira and Trello
- 🤖 Exploring the intersection of AI and cloud — building prototypes with LLMs (Azure OpenAI, DeepSeek, Ollama) for use cases like log summarization and automation
- ⛓️ Experimenting with blockchain technologies and smart contracts using Solidity
- 🔧 Also exploring low-code and rapid-development tools like Firebase and Back4App for certain projects

I enjoy learning by building and collaborating with others. I’m always looking to improve my understanding of scalable systems, system design, and modern development practices.
